## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL. Used TinyURL API which has a limit of 100 links (free tier)
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Netlify functions
- TinyURL API
- Sass/SCSS

### What I learned

The landing page design was very clean and I didn't have many issues coding it. I tried using the API suggested but I noticed it was on several occasions redirecting to some strange and questionable sites. So I opted to use the TinyURL API which is much more reliable. In this challenge I got the chance to practice integrating the API along with JS form validation and rendering the results. I had to use Netlify to store the API key which was a good experience as I've only used it a few times at this point.

### Continued development

In encountering the issue with the suggested API, it's now in my near future plans to attempt to create my own url shortening api. That will be a very useful challenge.
